# Lemonade Stand Assistant

## Acknowledgement

This quickstart is based on the demo by Trusty AI team. It can be found [here](https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/trustyai-llm-demo/tree/lemonade-stand). If you like this demo, we encourage people to contribute to the community of TrustyAI.

## Overview

Imagine we run a successful lemonade stand and want to deploy a customer service agent so our customers can learn more about our products. We'll want to make sure all conversations with the agent are family friendly, and that it does not promote our rival fruit juice vendors.

This demo showcases how to deploy an AI-powered customer service assistant with multiple guardrails to ensure safe, compliant, and on-brand interactions. The solution uses Llama 3.2 as the base language model, protected by three detector models that monitor for harmful content, prompt injection attacks, and language compliance.

## Detailed description

The Lemonade Stand Assistant provides an interactive customer service experience for a fictional lemonade stand business. Customers can ask questions about products, ingredients, pricing, and more through a conversational interface.

To ensure safe and appropriate interactions, the system employs multiple AI guardrails:
- **IBM HAP Detector**: Monitors conversations for hate, abuse, and profanity
- **Prompt Injection Detector**: Identifies and blocks attempts to manipulate the AI assistant
- **Language Detector**: Ensures responses are in acceptable languages (English and Turkish)

Furthemore, there is a:
- **Regex Detector**: Blocks specific text without the use of models. In our case, its other fruits we consider "competitors".

The guardrails orchestrator coordinates these detectors to evaluate inputs and outputs before presenting responses to users.

## Requirements

### Minimum hardware requirements

This demo is designed to run an LLM and guardrail models using GPU acceleration. The following hardware resources are required:

**Llama 3.2 3B Instruct (Main LLM):**
- CPU: 1 vCPU (request) / 4 vCPU (limit)
- Memory: 8 GiB (request) / 20 GiB (limit)
- GPU: 1 NVIDIA GPU

**IBM HAP Detector (Granite Guardian HAP 125M):**
- CPU: 1 vCPU (request) / 2 vCPU (limit)
- Memory: 4 GiB (request) / 8 GiB (limit)
- GPU: 1 NVIDIA GPU

**Prompt Injection Detector (Llama Prompt Guard 86M):**
- CPU: 1 vCPU (request) / 2 vCPU (limit)
- Memory: 4 GiB (request) / 8 GiB (limit)
- GPU: 1 NVIDIA GPU

**Language Detector (XLM-RoBERTa Base):**
- CPU: 1 vCPU (request) / 1 vCPU (limit)
- Memory: 6 GiB (request) / 12 GiB (limit)
- GPU: 1 NVIDIA GPU

**Total Resource Requirements:**
- CPU: 4 vCPU (request) / 9 vCPU (limit)
- Memory: 22 GiB (request) / 48 GiB (limit)
- GPU: 4 NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., A10, A100, L40S, T4, or similar)

### Minimum software requirements

- Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
- Red Hat OpenShift AI

### Required user permissions

Standard user. No elevated cluster permissions required.

## Deploy

### Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
- Access to a Red Hat OpenShift cluster with OpenShift AI installed
- `oc` CLI tool installed and configured
- `helm` CLI tool installed
- Sufficient GPU resources available in your cluster

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart/lemonade-stand-assistant.git
cd lemonade-stand-assistant
```

2. Create a new OpenShift project:
```bash
PROJECT="lemonade-stand-assistant"
oc new-project ${PROJECT}
```

3. Install using Helm:
```bash
helm install lemonade-stand-assistant ./chart --namespace ${PROJECT}
```

### Validating the deployment

Once deployed, access the Lemonade Stand Assistant UI. You can find the route with:

```bash
echo https://$(oc get route/lemonade-stand-assistant -n ${PROJECT} --template='{{.spec.host}}')
```

Open the URL in your browser and start asking questions about lemonade and other fruits!

### Uninstall

To remove the deployment:

```bash
helm uninstall lemonade-stand-assistant --namespace ${PROJECT}
```

## Technical details

### Architecture

The Lemonade Stand Assistant consists of the following components:

**Inference Services:**
- **Llama 3.2 3B Instruct**: Main language model for generating responses
- **IBM HAP Detector (Granite Guardian HAP 125M)**: Detects hate, abuse, and profanity
- **Prompt Injection Detector (Llama Prompt Guard 86M)**: Identifies prompt injection attempts
- **Language Detector (XLM-RoBERTa Base)**: Validates language compliance (English/Turkish)

**Orchestration:**
- **Guardrails Orchestrator**: Coordinates detector models using FMS Orchestr8
- **Shiny Application**: Provides the user interface for customer interactions

### Models

| Component | Model | Size | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|------|---------|
| Main LLM | Llama 3.2 3B Instruct | 3B parameters | Conversational AI |
| HAP Detection | Granite Guardian HAP | 125M parameters | Content safety |
| Prompt Guard | Llama Prompt Guard | 86M parameters | Security |
| Language Detection | XLM-RoBERTa Base | ~270M parameters | Language validation |

### Deployment Configuration

All models are deployed as KServe InferenceServices on OpenShift AI using:
- vLLM runtime for the main LLM (optimized inference)
- Guardrails Detector runtime for all detector models
- Raw deployment mode for better control and observability
